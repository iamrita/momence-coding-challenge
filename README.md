# Project Description

This app uses Javascript, React (+ Hooks), Styled Components, and React Query to do the following. 

1. When it starts, retrieves the latest currency exchange rates from the Czech National Bank.

2. Parses the downloaded data and clearly displays it to the user in the UI.
3. Adds a simple form, into which the customer can enter an amount in CZK and select a currency, and after clicking a button sees the amount entered in CZK converted into the selected currency.

To run the app, in the project directory run `npm start`. A gif of the working app is below: 




Note: Although I have not used Typescript extensively, I am currently learning it on my own, and am excited to pick it up quickly!
